# Talao DAO React.js proto TODO list

## Features

+ token: use final contract
+ ... list TODO

## Tech

+ refactor Objection & ObjectionForm.js
+ better use react.web3 (use provided context?)
+ (use .env files to manage networks & contract addresses OR fix migrations with Truffle & Parity) AND find a way to get ABIs and addresses in React
+ Rails flash messages
+ ...

## Bugs

+ Firefox / Ubuntu: when you send tokens, the txn hash displays but it should be replaced by the event message when the block is mined (works fine under Chrome)
