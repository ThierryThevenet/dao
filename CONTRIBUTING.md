# Contributing to Talao DAO

First, welcome to the project and thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

## Interface

The interface is based on Facebook's [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). We will need to add new tools but we would like to keep the project as simple as possible. Please provide a rationale as to why we really should add something.

At the moment we have:

+ Base: [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
+ Web3: [react-web3](https://github.com/coopermaruyama/react-web3)
+ CSS: [purecss](https://purecss.io/) (we will need a more complete framework & probably will stay without SASS/LESS since it's not so usefull with React)
+ Icons: [react-fontawesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/react-fontawesome)
